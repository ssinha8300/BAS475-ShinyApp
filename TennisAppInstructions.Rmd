**Welcome to the Tennis Statistics App!**
  
In this app, you will be able to analyze and conduct various time series analysis for statistical data of various top ATP tennis players from the 1990's until now. Each tab will allow you to see and understand various analyses of the common statistics that players and coaches look at today. Through this app, you can compare a player like Pete Sampras with a player like Rafael Nadal, even though they never played in the same era! (NOTE: the ATP didn't start recording statistical player data until 1991, so any player that turned pro before then won't have any statistics recorded until 1991)

**Tsibble:** In this tab, you will be able to select the correct index and key for the statistical data provided (HINT: there are two keys). Once you select them, the app will create a time series table, or a tsibble, for you.

**Stats by Year:** In this tab, you will be able to select the players and the career year they played, along with the statistics you want to see. The app will then create a custom table with your desired information. If you want to change anything, simply click on your items in the picker inputs and click the button again, and your custom table will automatically change. For example, if I wanted to see the number of aces the Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, and Rafael Nadal hit in the 6th year of their career, I'd select those options and create my custom table.

**Career Stats:** This tab is similar to the Stats by Year tab. However, it will now create a custom table of the career statistics you want to see for each player you choose.

**Player Comparison:** In this tab, you can select the radio button for whether you want to see a graph for yearly statistics or career statistics. If you select yearly stats, you can choose the players and career years you want to see, along with the specific statistic. The result will be a time series graph comparing your chosen players in your chosen years. If you select career stats, you can select the players and statistic you want, and the result will show a bar graph comparing that career statistic between all your chosen players.

**Transformations:** This tab will allow you to transform your data in order to account for any abnormal trends or heteroskedasticity in the data. Simply select the player, statistic, and they type of transformation you would like to perform. The output will show a new plot with your chosen transformation.

**Forecasting:** This tab will allow you to create forecasting models and check the accuracy and residuals for your chosen player and statistic. After selecting the player and statistic, select the type of model you want, and how many years ahead you want to forecast. If you selected the forecast option, you will see a table of forecasted values for the model you chose and a graph that plots the players' yearly statistic numbers along with the forecasted values. The residuals option will show the Ljung-Box test of your chosen parameters, along with the residuals plot. The accuracy option will show the accuracy of your parameters and model in terms of RMSE (along with other values), and you will see a plot of the actual statistical values plotted against the values fitted by the model.

**Exponential Smoothing:** This tab will allow you to create forecasting models and check the accuracy, components, and residuals for exponential smoothing models of your chosen player and statistic. After selecting the player and statistic, select how many years ahead you want to forecast. If you selected the forecast option, you will see a table of forecasted values for the model you chose and a graph that plots the players' yearly statistic numbers along with the forecasted values. The residuals option will show the Ljung-Box test of your chosen parameters, along with the residuals plot. The accuracy option will show the accuracy of your parameters and model in terms of RMSE (along with other values), and you will see a plot of the actual statistical values plotted against the values fitted by the model. Lastly, the components option will show an exponential smoothing component graph of your selected parameters.

**ARIMA:** This tab will allow you to create forecasting models and check the accuracy, residuals, and report for the best ARIMA model of your chosen player and statistic. After selecting the player and statistic, select how many years ahead you want to forecast. If you selected the forecast option, you will see a table of forecasted values for the model you chose and a graph that plots the players' yearly statistic numbers along with the forecasted values. The residuals option will show the Ljung-Box test of your chosen parameters, along with the residuals plot. The accuracy option will show the accuracy of your parameters and model in terms of RMSE (along with other values), and you will see a plot of the actual statistical values plotted against the values fitted by the model. Lastly, the report will show the pdq parameters of the ARIMA model, as well as the AIC, AICc, and BIC value.

**Custom ARIMA:** This tab will allow you to create forecasting models and check the accuracy, residuals, and report for your determined ARIMA model of your chosen player and statistic. First, type in the values of p, d, and q you want your ARIMA model to have. After selecting the player and statistic, select how many years ahead you want to forecast. If you selected the forecast option, you will see a table of forecasted values for the model you chose and a graph that plots the players' yearly statistic numbers along with the forecasted values. The residuals option will show the Ljung-Box test of your chosen parameters, along with the residuals plot. The accuracy option will show the accuracy of your parameters and model in terms of RMSE (along with other values), and you will see a plot of the actual statistical values plotted against the values fitted by the model. Lastly, the report will show the pdq parameters of the ARIMA model, as well as the AIC, AICc, and BIC value.

**Linear Regression:** This tab will allow you to create forecasting models and check the accuracy and residuals for the trend linear regression of your chosen player and statistic. After selecting the player and statistic, select how many years ahead you want to forecast. If you selected the forecast option, you will see a table of forecasted values for the model you chose and a graph that plots the players' yearly statistic numbers along with the forecasted values. The residuals option will show the Ljung-Box test of your chosen parameters, along with the residuals plot. The accuracy option will show the accuracy of your parameters and model in terms of RMSE (along with other values), and you will see a plot of the actual statistical values plotted against the values fitted by the model.

**Specific Linear Models:** Lastly, this provides options of selecting a linear model with the x and y variables as possible statistics. Simply select the player you want, the specific linear model you want from the dropdown list, and the number of years ahead you want to forecast. Once you click on the button, you will be able to see your forecasted graph and forecasted values, the accuracy of the model along with a plot of model fitted and actual values, or a residual plot with the Ljung-Box test.

**Enjoy as you compare statistics of current and retired players side by side! Who do you think would win if these players got a chance to play each other in their prime?**
