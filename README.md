# BAS475-ShinyApp

This is a time series forecasting app I develop using R Shiny in my undergraduate time series forecasting class. I developed the dataset by adding in yearly tennis statistics of various top players, both past and present, to a csv file, which is loaded into the app. There are various descriptive statistics graphs and time series forecasting model that can be run with the created data, and instructions are within each tab on what to do. Feel free to download the code files and run the app for yourself.
