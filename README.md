# BAS475-ShinyApp

This is a time series forecasting app I develop using R Shiny in my undergraduate time series forecasting class. I developed the dataset by adding in yearly tennis statistics of various top players, both past and present, to a csv file, which is loaded into the app. There are various descriptive statistics graphs and time series forecasting model that can be run with the created data, and instructions are within each tab on what to do. Feel free to download the code files and run the app for yourself.

Fair warning, this app is a primitive attempt at creating an R Shiny app for time series forecasting given the knowledge I obtained during the Fall 2021 semester. Given the knowledge I have know, I'd definitely do things differently, but my work then was based off of how much I knew and how much time I had to complete this project. There's also a possibility that some features might not work now with R's new updates, but they were all working at the time this project was made.
